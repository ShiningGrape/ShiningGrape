-  Hi, I’m @ShiningGrape, or Grape for short.
-  I’m not interested in learning something in specific for the time being.
-  I’m currently learning how to use Python correctly.
-  I’m not looking to collaborate on any projects, for now.
-  How to reach me? You can find me on Discord as Grape#2190. or in Reddit, as u/ShiningGrape.
